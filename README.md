# ECOQUEST


Project Story: SustainableLiving

## Inspiration
The inspiration for SustainableLiving+ struck when considering the immense impact small, daily choices can have on the environment. We envisioned a tool that not only educates but actively guides users towards a more sustainable lifestyle. The idea was to create a solution that is personalized, engaging, and social, making eco-friendly choices a collective effort.

## What it does
Personalized Eco-Footprint Assessment.
Tailored Sustainable Tasks.
Gamification Elements.
Community Engagement.

## How we built it

"We built this project by leveraging Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries for data processing and visualization. The survey data, collected over the past 5-10 years, was carefully analyzed, mapped, and graphically represented to create an insightful line graph. Our aim was to raise awareness about individual sustainability practices and inspire positive environmental action."

Survey System:
Development: Implemented a survey system to collect user data regarding daily habits and activities.
Data Processing: Developed algorithms to process survey data and generate a personalized eco-footprint assessment.
Task Generation:
Algorithm Development: Created algorithms to generate tailored tasks and challenges based on the user's eco-footprint.
Gamification Elements:
Point System: Developed a point system to reward users for completing tasks and achieving sustainability milestones.
Badge and Level Design: Designed badges and levels to enhance gamification elements and user motivation.

## Challenges we ran into
Data Privacy: Ensuring the security and privacy of user data in the community section is required. Careful consideration and robust measures would be taken.
Community Moderation: Verification of the shared content authenticity presented challenges in maintaining a positive community environment.
Time Constraints: Given the limited timeframe of a 30-hour hackathon, working on the main "Task generation algorithm", which is the backend of the app has been completed.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Personalized Sustainability: Successfully implemented a survey system to gather user data and provide personalized insights into individual eco-footprints, making sustainability education more relevant and actionable.
Task Generation Algorithm: Developed a robust algorithm to generate tailored tasks based on user profiles, encouraging users to adopt eco-friendly habits that align with their lifestyle and preferences.
Community Integration: Seamlessly integrated a social platform within the app, fostering a vibrant community where users can share achievements and collectively contribute to a sustainable lifestyle.

## What we learned
Data Privacy is Paramount: Implementing robust data privacy measures is crucial. Users are more likely to engage with an app that prioritizes the security and responsible handling of their personal information.
Time Management is Critical: The constraints of a 30-hour hackathon emphasized the importance of effective time management. Refining the concept within the limited timeframe ensured the development of a functional Backend.

## What's next for Eco Quest
Iterative Development: Implement updates and improvements based on user feedback. Iterate on the app's features, user interface, and overall user experience to enhance engagement and effectiveness.
Gamification Enhancements: Introduction of VR, Evolve the gamification elements to keep users motivated. Introduce new levels, challenges, and rewards to maintain interest and encourage long-term engagement.
